# RobloxAPI-python
A Python wrapper for Roblox's REST API.
You can read documentation on the Wiki page of this GitHub repo.

## Prerequisites:
You need to have the requests Python module installed in order to use this API Wrapper. If you don't have it installed, please install it using
```bash
pip install requests
```
**Another requirement is that you need to add your cookie to the API wrapper.** Please see [this wiki page](https://github.com/JohnMackYouTube05/RobloxAPI-python/wiki/Adding-your-Roblox-Security-Cookie-to-the-API-Wrapper) for more information on how to do so.
