# RobloxAPI-python
A Python wrapper for Roblox's REST API.
You can read documentation on the Wiki page of this GitHub repo.

## Prerequisites:
You need to have the requests Python module, and the Pillow Python module installed in order to use this API Wrapper. If you don't have it installed, please install it using
```bash
pip install requests
pip install pillow
```
or you can just use
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
inside the folder after downloading the API.

**Another requirement is that you need to add your cookie to the API wrapper.** Please see [this wiki page](https://github.com/JohnMackYouTube05/RobloxAPI-python/wiki/Adding-your-Roblox-Security-Cookie-to-the-API-Wrapper) for more information on how to do so.
